# AETHERIS ORBITAL 🚀

> **"The Cosmos Is Calling."**

Aetheris Orbital is a **cinema-grade space travel master prompt** website designed to evoke awe, luxury, and the thrill of deep space exploration. Built with **Next.js 14**, **Tailwind CSS**, **Framer Motion**, and **Three.js**, it bridges the gap between functional UI and immersive digital art.

## 🌌 Mission Brief

The goal of this project was to create a **"NASA × Apple × Cyberpunk"** interface that feels like a legitimate 22nd-century spacecraft booking system. It features:
*   **Parallax Depth**: Layers of stars, text, and UI elements moving at different speeds.
*   **Holographic UI**: Glassmorphism, scanning lines, and digital HUD readouts.
*   **Cinematic Visuals**: 4K generated backgrounds and 3D starfields.
*   **Smooth Navigation**: Inertial scrolling via `Lenis` and fluid page transitions.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

*   **Framework**: [Next.js 14 (App Router)](https://nextjs.org/)
*   **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS v4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
*   **Animations**: [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/)
*   **3D Context**: [React Three Fiber](https://docs.pmnd.rs/react-three-fiber) & [Drei](https://github.com/pmndrs/drei)
*   **Smooth Scroll**: [Lenis](https://lenis.studiofreight.com/)
*   **Typography**: `Orbitron` (Headers) & `JetBrains Mono` (Data)

## 🌟 Key Features

### 1. The Launchpad (Hero Section)
A massive, screen-filling typographic experience with a real-time generated **3D Starfield**. The text parallax effects give a sense of depth as you scroll into the void.

### 2. Destination Trajectories
Interactive, **Holographic Cards** for:
*   **Artemis Base (Moon)**: Low-gravity luxury.
*   **Olympus Mons (Mars)**: Terraformed volcanic resort.
*   **Orbital Lounge (Saturn)**: Zero-G fine dining in the rings.

Each card features a tilt-parallax effect and "Active Camo" image reveals.

### 3. The Fleet (Digital Hangar)
A horizontal scrolling "hangar" showcasing our flagship vessels:
*   **Aetheris-X**: Deep Space Cruiser.
*   **Void Runner**: Stealth Orbital Shuttle.
*   **Star Hopper**: Atmospheric Glider.

Features **scanning laser animations**, tech-grid backgrounds, and responsive ship specifications.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Clone the repository and prepare for launch.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/anshtripathi6969/orbital.git

# Navigate to mission control
cd aetheris-orbital

# Install life support systems (dependencies)
npm install

# Initiate launch sequence (dev server)
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view the interface.

## ⚠️ Notes

*   **Tailwind v4 Compatibility**: Use `npm run dev` for the best experience. The build process uses a compatibility layer for the bleeding-edge CSS engine.
*   **Performance**: Optimized for Desktop (Cinematic View), but fully responsive for mobile communicators.
